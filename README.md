# grap2vec
###See the Untitled0 ipynb for a example implementation from start to finish of the whole algo
####perms.py contain the permutation generator via recursion 
####perm_matrix contains the code for generation of all isomorphic subgraph and mapping any subgraph to hashmap
####try.txt contains the graph reprsentation for one subgraph of size 2 and all its neigbour.We still have to figure out the output of word2vec basically what node number is it mapping to.
